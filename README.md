Hi Juan
When viewing your job description  it really jumped out at me. Because  I have extensive experience in REACTJS frontend development, implementing  redux and redux-saga for state management and react-hooks  for binding between states and components. Formik for form submission success callback and Material-UI for UI design. I have reviewed my calendar and I'm ready to get started immediately.

have completed numerous ReactJs  project and application which I can adapt and implement it features and framework to your job. 

I am able to offer you my services and skill at the rate of $15/h, because I know I am okay with it and I  can deliver this below features to your job:
   • redux and redux-saga, to handle all state management effectively
   •  Material-UI for, UI such as pop modals, cards and Buttons and design. 
   •  Formik for any form submission handling, such as success callback and error handling. 

I have included samples and links of my past projects is built using reactjs, Material-UI and formik. I am looking forward in discussing this project further with you.
